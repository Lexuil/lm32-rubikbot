  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Number of errors   :   4
Number of warnings :   4

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:543 - This design does not fit into the number of slices available
   in this device due to the complexity of the design and/or constraints.

   Unplaced instances by type:

     FF    42 (9.9%)
     LUT    252 (31.5%)

   Please evaluate the following:

   - If there are user-defined constraints or area groups:
     Please look at the "User-defined constraints" section below to determine
     what constraints might be impacting the fitting of this design.
     Evaluate if they can be moved, removed or resized to allow for fitting.
     Verify that they do not overlap or conflict with clock region restrictions.
     See the clock region reports in the MAP log file (*map) for more details
     on clock region usage.

   - If there is difficulty in placing LUTs:
     Try using the MAP LUT Combining Option (map lc area|auto|off).

   - If there is difficulty in placing FFs:
     Evaluate the number and configuration of the control sets in your design.

ERROR:Place:543 - This design does not fit into the number of slices available
   in this device due to the complexity of the design and/or constraints.

   Unplaced instances by type:

     LUTL    10 (0.6%)
     LUTM    112 (82.4%)

   Please evaluate the following:

   - If there are user-defined constraints or area groups:
     Please look at the "User-defined constraints" section below to determine
     what constraints might be impacting the fitting of this design.
     Evaluate if they can be moved, removed or resized to allow for fitting.
     Verify that they do not overlap or conflict with clock region restrictions.
     See the clock region reports in the MAP log file (*map) for more details
     on clock region usage.

   - If there is difficulty in placing LUTs:
     Try using the MAP LUT Combining Option (map lc area|auto|off).

   - If there is difficulty in placing FFs:
     Evaluate the number and configuration of the control sets in your design.
